** COMPILING **

  This will only build on OSX or Linux (tested on Ubuntu 10.10 - you will need
  libglut3-dev for this to work).

  To build run 'make'

  To execute run './prog1 [--buckets <bucket_count>] <path_to_data_file>'. The
  supplied data files are located in the 'data' directory. Use the '--buckets'
  option to specify a positive, non-zero number of buckets to use when
  discretizing the data set.
